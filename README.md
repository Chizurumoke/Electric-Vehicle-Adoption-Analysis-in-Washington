# Electric-Vehicle-Adoption-Analysis-in-Washington
This project aims to provide insights to help improve infrastructure and policies for wider EV adoption.
PROBLEM SETTING
As cities and regions move toward more environmentally friendly transportation options, electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming more and more significant. While electric vehicle (EV) adoption is growing in Washington State due to infrastructure upgrades and incentives, different regions have varying adoption rates. The challenge for policymakers is identifying areas with lower adoption and addressing the reasons for the discrepancy. This project aims to provide insights to help improve infrastructure and policies for wider EV adoption.
PROBLEM DEFINITION
The primary goal of this project is to analyze electric vehicle adoption across Washington State. Below are the specific objectives of this project:
•	To predict whether a vehicle qualifies for state incentives based on MSRP, electric range, and type
•	To understand trends in EV adoption based on vehicle characteristics like make, model, and year
•	To evaluate the significance of geographic and socioeconomic factors like city, county, and electric utility.
•	To predict the electric range based on features like model year, make, and type.
•	To compare the different Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility categories by focusing on attributes such as EV Count, Electric Range, Base and trends across CAFV Eligibility (i.e., whether a vehicle is eligible for state incentives or not).
•	To suggest policy interventions could encourage higher EV adoption in underperforming regions
DATA SOURCE
The dataset used for this project is provided by the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) and is available for public use. It contains detailed information on registered Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) across the state.
